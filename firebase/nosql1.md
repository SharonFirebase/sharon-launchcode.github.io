general notes on NoSQL data modeling:

NoSQL data modeling often starts from the application-specific queries as opposed to relational modeling:
Relational modeling is typically driven by the structure of available data. The main design theme is  “What answers do I have?” 
NoSQL data modeling is typically driven by application-specific access patterns, i.e. the types of queries to be supported. The main design theme is “What questions do I have?”  

Data duplication and denormalization are first-class citizens.
