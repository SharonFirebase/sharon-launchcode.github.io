##### EXCERPT
        ...Legal aid groups in Cleveland and Akron usually turn away about half of all people seeking assistance.

        Like other areas, lack of resources has prevented Community Legal Aid from addressing needs in Wayne County to the extent it wants to.
        

                ``` "It's an issue we've been searching for ways to address for years, and not just here," McGarrity said. "But what's great about Wayne County is the amazing partnerships and people's willingness to help us bridge that gap. It wouldn't have been possible without Community Action, or other groups like United Way." ```

##### There is no financial component associated with the virtual legal assistance.
