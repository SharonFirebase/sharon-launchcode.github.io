###### What is Dialogflow

```Dialogflow was called API.AI before getting acquired by Google. Since the acquisition, the entire Dialogflow service has become free and available to Google Cloud Platform users. GCP on the other hand isnâ€™t. GCP does have a free tier similar to the AWS free tier. I have signed up for both AWS and GCP. I got a 300 dollar credit for the free tier version on GCP. To sign up for GCP, follow this link and watch for the free tier.```
