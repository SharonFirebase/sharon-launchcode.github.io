##### Excerpt 
Description
A STUN/TURN server is used for NAT traversal in VoIP. Whether you're at home behind a common router, at work behind an enterprise firewall, or traveling, chances are that you will be behind a NAT which must be traversed before making calls.

Our server, Numb, will help your SIP phone automatically punch holes in the NAT. As a solution of last resort, it will simply act as a relay between you and the person you're talking to when end-to-end connectivity just isn't possible.

Numb is a free service by Viag√©nie.

Features
Numb conforms to the following specifications:

RFC 3489, "STUN - Simple Traversal of User Datagram Protocol (UDP) Through Network Address Translators (NATs)"

RFC 6156, "Traversal Using Relays around NAT (TURN) Extension for IPv6"
Numb listens at numb.viagenie.ca on the usual STUN/TURN port number (3478).
