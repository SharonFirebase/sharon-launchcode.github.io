##### Dialogflow versioning
##### https://developers.google.com/actions/dialogflow/submit-app#dialogflow_versioning

Note: Starting May 8, 2018, any new Action submission will create a snapshot of your Dialogflow agent at the time of submission. This snapshot (or version) will not be impacted by any future edits you make to your Dialogflow agent. For edits to go live, youâ€™ll need to submit your draft for alpha, beta, or production release in the Actions Console.
